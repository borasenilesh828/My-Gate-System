# My-Gate-System
Project Overview
The Gate Pass Generator is a web-based application developed using Node.js and SQL, designed to streamline the process of generating and managing gate passes for visitors or employees. This project automates the issuance, tracking, and validation of gate passes, providing a secure and efficient way to manage access to a facility.

Key Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can register and log in to request gate passes. Admins can manage user roles and permissions.
Gate Pass Request: Users can easily request a gate pass by filling out a form with necessary details such as name, purpose of visit, and duration.
Admin Approval: Admins can view, approve, or reject gate pass requests. Approved requests automatically generate a unique gate pass ID.
SQL Database Integration: All gate pass requests, user data, and approval statuses are stored securely in an SQL database, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval.
Real-Time Updates: Node.js ensures that the application provides real-time updates to users on the status of their gate pass requests.
Search and Filter: Admins can search and filter gate passes by date, user, or status, making it easy to manage large volumes of requests.
How It Works
User Registration: New users can sign up and log in to the system to request a gate pass.
Gate Pass Request: Users submit a request by entering details such as visit purpose, date, and duration.
Admin Review: Admins review incoming requests and approve or reject them. Approved passes are assigned a unique ID and status.
Pass Generation: Once approved, the gate pass is generated with a unique ID, which users can print or show on their device when accessing the facility.
Database Management: All requests and approvals are stored in an SQL database, which the admin can query for reports and audits.
Technologies Used
Node.js: For building the back-end server, handling requests, and managing real-time updates.
SQL: For storing and managing data related to users, gate pass requests, and approvals.
Express.js: For handling routing and server-side logic.
HTML/CSS: For the front-end interface where users and admins interact with the system.
JavaScript: For client-side interactivity and validation.
This Gate Pass Generator project offers a secure and efficient solution for managing facility access, making it easier to track and control entry points.
